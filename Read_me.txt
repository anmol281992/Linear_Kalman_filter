 

In this code: I have implemented a Linear Kalman filter over a 4D noisy vector across time. 

The “random_generated_vector_series.txt” comprises of 4D vector over 15 time samples. The 4D vector is represented by the each row in the text file. After implementing the Kalman filter we reach a denoised vector and store the vector in “Kalman_filter_smoothed_data_series.txt”. We store the output in the same format as data in “random_generated_vector_series.txt”.
